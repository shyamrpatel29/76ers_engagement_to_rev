Pipeline + models linking Philadelphia 76ers fan sentiment, injuries, and ticketing data to revenue predictions.

In 2024–25, the Philadelphia 76ers entered the season with huge hype after signing Paul George to join Joel Embiid.
Despite this, attendance and ticket revenue proved volatile due to injuries, poor performance, and shifting fan sentiment.

This project predicts game-day attendance % and ticket revenue, diagnoses key drivers (injury, ticket pricing, sentiment, opponent strength),
and recommends actions for pricing, retention, and fan communication.

**Deliverables:**
- Automated ETL pipeline (Selenium → Snowflake).
- Predictive models with explainability (attendance %).
- Interactive dashboards (Tableau, Streamlit).
- Executive-style presentation with quantified recommendations.

**Business Value:** A data-driven framework for converting fan engagement into stable, predictable revenue.
